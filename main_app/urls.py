    # Here is where we define the main_app's homepage URL & view
    # HOMEPAGE DEFINED HERE:
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    # The above code defines a root path using an empty string and maps it to the view.home view function that does not exist yet. 
    # Weâ€™ll remedy this with a new view in the next step.

# Addtl notes:
# The name='home' kwarg is technically optional but will come in handy for referencing the URL in other parts of the app, 
# especially from within templates, so we will always use it.
