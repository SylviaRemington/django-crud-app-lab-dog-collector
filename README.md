## About

**Welcome to Dog Collector, my first venture into building a full CRUD application using Django!** 

This project is an excellent example of what I'm capable of creating for future full-stack Django projects, and more! This Django Creation is done with HTML templates for practice. 

Dog Collector is a playful application where a user can manage a database of cute puppies/dogs and their toys. Throughout this project, I'll be learning how to implement full CRUD operations in a PostgreSQL Database as well as establish User Authentication and Authorization. Yay!

This hands-on project will help solidify my understanding of Djangoâ€™s awesome built in capabilities; and also will prepare me for creating my own full-stack web applications in Django into the future! Woot woot.
